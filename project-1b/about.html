        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>My name is Evan Michell, my artist name is Chimney Michell. I am non-binary. My primary focus is on production and songwriting. I play instruments. I write songs. i want (so bad)to make you dance. I come from the city of New Orleans. I love the smell of Bergamot. I’m like a girl. I like riding my bicycle and playing catch. I listen to a lot of Kate Bush and I cry in my bedroom a lot. I like it when the blanket is on top of my head covering my whole body because i get to be alone. I’m excited to be alive. I have music coming to streaming soon.
